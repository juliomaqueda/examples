/*
 * By default, for all methods that return a value, a mock will return either null, a a primitive/primitive wrapper value,
 * or an empty collection, as appropriate. For example 0 for an int/Integer and false for a boolean/Boolean.
 * 
 * Stubbing can be overridden: for example common stubbing can go to fixture setup but the test methods can override it.
 * Please note that overriding stubbing is a potential code smell that points out too much stubbing.
 * 
 * Once stubbed, the method will always return a stubbed value, regardless of how many times it is called.
 * 
 * Last stubbing is more important - when you stubbed the same method with the same arguments many times.
 * Other words: the order of stubbing matters but it is only meaningful rarely, e.g. when stubbing exactly the same method
 * calls or sometimes when argument matchers are used, etc.
